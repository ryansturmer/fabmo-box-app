# Boxcutter
App for creating simple boxes with finger joints.

# Usage
This app creates box parts one at a time.  There are two bottom styles:

 * Slot: A slot is cut along the bottom edge of sides, for a solid rectangular bottom to slide in.
 * Finger-Jointed: The bottom edges of the sides are tabbed, with the botom being tabbed to mate, like the sides
